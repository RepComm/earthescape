A voxel lan multiplayer ship building game

Built using:
- [deno](deno.land) as the TypeScript tcp server software
- [unity](unity3d.com) as the game engine
- A lot of abstracted classes..

This is not ready for wide use yet, but I'm putting the<br/>
multiplayer layer together lately and it's coming along pretty nice.

## Planned features
\* focal points of the project
- Logic circuits *
- LAN *
- Voxel ships *
- Large playground (Vector3 isn't enough)
